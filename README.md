### Bikeshare Project
bikeshare_project.py

### Description
Bikeshare_project.py is an interactive program that allows a user to explore bikeshare data from three cities: Chicago, New York City and Washington. The user can choose to view data globally (all three cities combined into a single dataframe), or to segment data by city, month and day of week. Once a dataframe is created, a menu allows the user to choose what data to view, and loops allow the user to make multiple subsequent menu selections, and even to create a new dataframe without exiting the program.

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
Any code reference necessary was pulled from Udacity course material, the python, pandas, or numpy documentation, and a few instances of
research on stack overflow. No blocks or strings of code were copied from any site.
